# Pending Calculator
 A calculator I made to practice tkinter speciifcally and Python in general.

I'm still very much a Python novice, as I'm sure if evident in my code, but for me, making this calculator was a big step forward, so I wanted to share it with others. Please feel free to let me know if you see any errors in my code or ways I could have done things better.

Thank you!
